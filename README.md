I created this game on android studio build on java using libGDX. You need to keep the bird flying and ignore obstacles. On passing through every pipe your score will be increased by '1'. libGDX is a relatively low level, free, open source cross platform 2D game development framework written in Java.  This list is a curated collection of awesome resources, tools, tutorials, and projects using the libGDX game framework to help developers make awesome games, conforming to the Awesome Manifesto. You can download the setup tool from https://libgdx.com/dev/project-generation/ this link
